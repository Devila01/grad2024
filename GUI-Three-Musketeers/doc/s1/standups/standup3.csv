Nov 29th,1,3,Zoya,Brainstormed ideas about how to modify my task such that I can still use the composite design pattern but do not have to create a complicated GUI (such as one for the board).,Finalizing how to implement or modify task 2.2 whether it be creating a new task or implementing the previous task differently. Also reflect these changes on the UML diagrams on designPatterns.pdf as well as the productBacklog.csv ,End of Today,Originally we had planned to implement a board GUI. So we were going to use the composite pattern to change the color of the board and the cells after each turn. But we decided not to implement the GUI so I tried changing the cell/board on the console instead. However it wouldnâ€™t make sense to use the composite pattern with the non-GUI implementation and I was not able to find a way to change the console text on Eclipse.
